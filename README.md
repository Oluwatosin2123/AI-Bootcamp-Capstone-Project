# Insurance Claim Prediction Model

## Project Overview
This project predicts the probability that a building will make at least one insurance claim using building characteristics.

## Objective
Build a binary classification model where:
- 1 = Claim occurred
- 0 = No claim

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib

## Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy
- ROC AUC Score
- Confusion Matrix

## Outcome
Random Forest achieved better performance and was used for probability prediction.
